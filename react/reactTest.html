to create a React application named my-react-app:
npx create-react-app my-react-app

Run the React Application:
cd my-react-app
npm start

When it runs, it should open a browser to here:
localhost:3000

May take a couple minutes to build.
The development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

Starting point for my-react-app:
src/App.js

To write React directly in html, start by including three scripts:
-->
<head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
<!-->
the first two let us write React code in our JavaScripts, 
and the third, Babel, allows us to write JSX syntax and ES6 in older browsers.

OK for testing purposes, but for production: set up a React environment
